Users can register and log in to the website. Registered users can add events on the calendar. Registered users can delete their events, but not the events of others. Unregistered users should see no events on the calendar.

All user and event data should be kept in a database.

Users can easily return to the month of the current date with a simple button.

Users can specify any month or year to change the month view to.

Users can change the theme color with a drop down.

Users can create group events by simply listing the usernames with a "," in between each username.

Users can edit and delete group events which will change or delete that event for the other members.
