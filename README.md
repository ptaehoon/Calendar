Users can easily return to the month of the current date with a simple button.

Users can specify any month or year to change the month view to.

Users can change the theme color with a drop down.

Users can create group events by simply listing the usernames with a "," in between each username.

Users can edit and delete group events which will change or delete that event for the other members.
